# PBJWrites Hugo Portfolio

I'm working on expanding my knowledge of static site generators and doc-as-code methodologies, so this will always be a work in progress as I learn more, develop more content, and adopt best practices. C'est tout. 

You can visit the site at [https://pbjwrites.info](https://pbjwrites.info).
